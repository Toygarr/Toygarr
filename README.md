Welcome to the GitHub profile that mostly contains studies which are artificial intelligence, university outputs and diary of a person who is trying to be involved in actual **brain science**.



## About Me

* I'm a senior student in Computer Engineering at Yildiz Technical University.
* I study and research in the lab, [IHIRC (Intelligent Healthcare & Innovation Research Centre)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/intelligent-healthcare-and-innovation-research-centre/mycompany/) at Yildiz Technical University. 
* I work on diagnosis and prognosis of posterior fossa tumors in children, and adenomyosis and fibroids in women under supervision of Dr. Bilgin Keserci.

### Past Research
* [Tactile Research Laboratory](https://bme.boun.edu.tr/tactile-research-laboratory) under supervision of Prof. Burak GÜÇLÜ. <br/> ⋅ Worked on spinal cord injuries and computational gait analyses of rats. Realized the experiments at [Vivarium](https://lifesci.boun.edu.tr/en/vivarium).
* Tübitak Research Project titled [Sort Optimization of Training Samples in Machine Learning](https://github.com/projectSOTS) under supervision of Prof. M. Fatih AMASYALI. <br/> ⋅ Worked on various interpolative data augmentation methods for BERT embeddings and distributed learning to decrease training time for curriculum learning.
* BAP Research Project [Autonomous rover design for extraterrestrial life trace research](https://rover.yildiz.edu.tr). <br/> ⋅ Implemented several real-time object detection models to direct movements of the rover, integrated ROS environment for communication of between camera and mothercard, and created many custom datasets for the task objectives.

```
I try to find my true love in the [Path of Neuroscience](https://github.com/Toygarr/neuroscience). 
This repository includes my pains, tears and lots of knowledge to may help you find a way to start 
neuroscience as a non-bio background individual. I mostly update daily or in a few days.

Well, here, repositories are my curious attempts to satisfy my desire of understanding how brain works from perspective of computer science. On the other hand, current literature decreases the reliability of artificial intelligence research. The main idea of AI stray away from its roots without nobody even realizing the problem.

Anyways, I am passionate about to deal with the mysterious structure of the brain and consciousness itself. I believe that brain is complex as much as the enormous universe, and has countless problems and arguments that are awaiting to be solved.

**My Interests:** <br/>
```
Neuroimaging
Neurophysiology / Neurobiology
Cognitive Science
Neural Signal Processing and Analysis
Natural Language Processing
```

My	strictly confidential plan is that creating a difference in computational neuroscience. <br/> Research is all we need, and being better than yesterday.
