Welcome to the GitHub profile that mostly contains studies which are academic papers, ai stuff, school things and diary of a person who is trying to be involved in actual brain science.



## About me

* I study and research for behavior, neurobiology and neurophysiology in Tactile Research Laboratory at Boğaziçi University.
* Specifically, work on spinal cord injuries and gait analyses of rats.
* I'm a senior student in Computer Science at Yildiz Technical University.

I try to find my true love in the [Path of Cognitive Neuroscience](https://github.com/Toygarr/cognitive-neuroscience). This repository includes my pains, tears and lots of knowledge to help you find a way to start neuroscience as a non-bio background individual. I mostly update daily or in a few days.

```"Though this be madness, yet there is method in’t."``` \- *William Shakespeare*

Well, here, repositories are my curious attempts to satisfy my desire of understanding how brain works from perspective of computer science. On the other hand, current literature is mostly depending on scale of models, and *in my opinion*, **scale** is not the thing we need. 

Anyways, I am passionate about to get more knowledge about actual functioning of the brain, but some says, brain won't let people to solve its mistery, who knows...

**My Interests:** <br/>
```
Neurophysiology / Neurobiology
Neural Signal Processing and Analysis
Computer Vision
Natural Language Processing
```

My	strictly confidential plan is that creating a difference in computational neuroscience. I believe that brain is complex as much as the enormous universe, and has countless uncovered and unknown arguments are awaiting to be solved. <br/> Research is all we need, and being better than yesterday.
